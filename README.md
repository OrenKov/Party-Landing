# Party-Landing
The landing page can be found [here](https://orenkov.github.io/party-landing-page/).
<br>

## Overview
A landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for marketing and promotes a single focus or goal.<br>
I decided to create a landing page to promote a party of my girlfriend, get an idea of who's coming, and collect payments for the party.

## Details
The landing page contains information about the party, as well as 2 buttons:
1. <strong> Attendance  Survey </strong>:
   * A link to a survey hosted by [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/).
2. <strong> Payment Link </strong>:
   * A link to a payment group hosted by [Bit](https://www.poalimsites.co.il/bit/index.html).
   * Note that the payment link was available only a week before and a week after the party.

<!-- ## Do It Yourself
If you would like to make your own landing page. -->

## Cerdits And Resources
* I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) with modifications, as a template for many of the CSS features being used in the website.
* I used [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) services to create the survey. Mailchimp inclues many marketing features, like forms and emails, and can be easily inserted into   your own website.
